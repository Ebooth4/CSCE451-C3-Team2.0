## Introduction

## Purpose of Our Script

## Installation Instructions:

This script makes use of the `networkx` python package, which requires a working python3 interpreter. However, Ghidra does not have a built-in python3 interpreter, so an extension is needed to allow our script to run.

To install the `networkx` package, make sure your python interpreter is up-to-date and run the following command in your terminal:

```
python -m pip install networkx
```

There are multiple options for python3 interpreters, but the one that we used is called Ghidrathon. To install this extension, follow the instructions laid out in Ghidrathon's repository at [https://github.com/mandiant/Ghidrathon](https://github.com/mandiant/Ghidrathon).

Once you have Ghidrathon installed, restart Ghidra and open the Script Manager window. Create a new script and make sure to select "Python 3" as the script type. Once the new script is open, simply copy and paste the code from our script into the text editor before saving and running the script.
